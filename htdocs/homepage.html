<h3>RDF</h3>



<!--

  <p>This site is very simple. It just provides URIs for UK academic sessions. It's intended that these URIs can be used to link data between UK university course data.</p>
  <p>Conceputally, these definitions are broader than the academic session of an institution, which will have actual start and end dates, but looser than the general interational concept which may vary start and end dates far more than in the UK. We define URIs for both UK and world academic sessions.</p>

  <h2>RDF</h2>
  <p>Each UK academic sesison is described as a <a href='http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/'>skos</a> concept, with the world-wide concept of an academic session being described as a <a href='http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/broader'>skos:broader</a> concept than the equivalent UK academic session. Each session is also described as a <a href='http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/timeline.owl#Interval'>timeline:Interval</a> with the proceeding and subsequent sessions linked via timeline:before and timeline:after.</p>
  <h3>UK Academic Sessions</h3>
  <p><tt>http://id.academic-session.data.ac.uk/<i>&lt;start-year&gt;</i>-<i>&lt;end-year&gt;</i></tt></p>
  <p>This represents an a one-year session in UK academia, starting at the end of the summer of one calendar year, and ending at the start of the summer of the subsequent calendar year.</p>

  <h3>World Academic Sessions</h3>
  <p><tt>http://id.academic-session.data.ac.uk/world/<i>&lt;start-year&gt;</i>-<i>&lt;end-year&gt;</i></tt></p>
  <p>This represents an a one-year session in international academia, starting in one calendar year, and ending in the subsequent calendar year.</p>

  <h3>Example URIs</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>http://id.academic-session.data.ac.uk/2009-2010</dt><dd>- URI for the UK academic session starting in 2009 and ending in 2010.</dd>
  <dt>http://id.academic-session.data.ac.uk/world/2008-2009</dt><dd>- URI for the general worldwide concept of an academic session starting in 2008 and ending in 2009.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Example URLs</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>http://academic-session.data.ac.uk/2009-2010.ttl</dt><dd>- Turtle RDF document describing the UK Academic Session 2009-2010.
 This won't display in a normal web-browser, so to view it use an RDF browser, eg. <a href='http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/browser/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Facademic-session.data.ac.uk%2F2009-2010.ttl'>Graphite Browser</a>.
</dd>
  <dt>http://academic-session.data.ac.uk/world/2008-2009.ttl</dt><dd>- Turtle RDF document describing the general worldwide concept of an academic session starting in 2008 and ending in 2009.

</dl>

<h3>Linking the Data</h3>

<p>We recommend that an individual UK institution should create their own URIs for their academic sessions, which will have known start and end dates. They should describe a narrower/broader relationship with the UK and world concepts.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a linked-data description of an academic session at the "University of Example". Their academic year starts on the 1st of October each year. Note that as we're using exact dates so +0100 is added for British Summer Time. The oo:formalOrganization links the session to the university which defines it (assuming their URI for themselves is &lt;http://id.example.ac.uk/&gt;). This university has also created a RDF class for their academic sessions, within their own local vocabulary.</p>
